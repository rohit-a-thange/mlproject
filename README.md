## End to End Machine Learning Project

Self notes:
Usually, there are mixed features (categorical & numerical) in a dataset.
To use mathematical operations on them together we have to convert categorical features into numerical.
We use OneHotEncoding to convert categorical features into numerical features.

After this we can use Standardization or Normalization techniques.
